COMPREHENSIVE PDF - FINAL HEADER FIX
======================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
Headers were breaking words across lines:
  - "Sl." on one line, "No." on another line
  - "Group" on one line, "No." on another line  
  - "Seat" on one line, "No." on another line

This made the headers hard to read and looked unprofessional.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
-----------------
Used &nbsp; (non-breaking space) in HTML to keep phrases together:
  
  Code changes:
  - <b>Sl.&nbsp;No.</b>     -> "Sl. No." stays on ONE line
  - <b>Group&nbsp;No.</b>   -> "Group No." stays on ONE line
  - <b>Seat&nbsp;No.</b>    -> "Seat No." stays on ONE line
  
  Also used <br/> for intentional two-line headers:
  - <b>Student<br/>Name</b>  -> "Student" / "Name" on two lines
  - <b>Project<br/>Guide</b> -> "Project" / "Guide" on two lines

RESULT:
-------
✓ Sl. No. - displays on ONE line (no word break)
✓ Group No. - displays on ONE line (no word break)
✓ Seat No. - displays on ONE line (no word break)
✓ Student Name - displays on TWO lines (Student / Name)
✓ Project Guide - displays on TWO lines (Project / Guide)
✓ USNs like "3GN22CS020" - display on ONE line (7pt font, 22mm column)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- Font size: 8pt for headers
- Leading: 10pt
- wordWrap: 'LTR' (left-to-right)
- splitLongWords: 0 (prevents word breaking)
- Column width for Seat No.: 22mm (increased from 18mm)
