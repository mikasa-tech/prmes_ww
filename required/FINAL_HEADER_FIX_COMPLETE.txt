COMPREHENSIVE PDF - ALL HEADER ISSUES FIXED
======================================================================

PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED FROM SCREENSHOT:
------------------------------------
1. "Group No." text colliding - 'p' was not visible/cut off
2. "Literature Survey" - 'e' breaking to next line
3. "Problem Identification" - words breaking awkwardly
4. "Project presentation Skill" - words breaking awkwardly
5. "Question and answer session" - words breaking awkwardly

ROOT CAUSES:
------------
- Font size too large for column width
- Insufficient padding causing text collision
- No smart line break logic for long headers
- Column widths too narrow

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------

1. FIXED "GROUP NO." COLLISION:
   - Split into two lines: "Group" / "No."
   - Reduced font size: 8pt -> 7pt
   - Increased leading: 10pt -> 9pt to prevent overlap
   - Increased column width: 13mm -> 14mm
   - Result: Clean display, all letters visible

2. FIXED CRITERIA HEADERS WORD BREAKING:
   - Implemented smart breaking logic:
     * "Literature Survey" -> "Literature" / "Survey" / "(20)"
     * "Problem Identification" -> "Problem" / "Identification" / "(10)"
     * "Project presentation Skill" -> "Project" / "presentation" / "Skill" / "(10)"
     * "Question and answer session" -> "Question" / "and answer" / "session" / "(10)"
   - Reduced font size: 9pt -> 6.5pt
   - Increased column width: 16mm -> 18mm
   - No words break awkwardly anymore!

3. FIXED ALL BASE HEADERS:
   - "Sl. No." -> "Sl." / "No." (two lines, clean)
   - "Group No." -> "Group" / "No." (two lines, clean)
   - "Seat No." -> "Seat" / "No." (two lines, clean)
   - "Student Name" -> "Student" / "Name" (two lines)
   - "Project Guide" -> "Project" / "Guide" (two lines)

4. COLUMN WIDTH ADJUSTMENTS:
   Before -> After
   - Sl. No.: 10mm -> 11mm (+1mm)
   - Group No.: 13mm -> 14mm (+1mm)
   - Seat No.: 22mm (no change)
   - Student Name: 36mm -> 35mm (-1mm)
   - Project Guide: 30mm -> 29mm (-1mm)
   - Criteria columns: 16mm -> 18mm (+2mm each) ← KEY FIX
   - Total: 14mm (no change)

5. PADDING ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Left/Right padding: 3mm -> 2mm (more room for text)
   - Top/Bottom padding (header): 8mm -> 6mm
   - Prevents text collision while maintaining clean look

RESULTS:
--------
✓ "Group No." displays cleanly - all letters visible, no collision
✓ "Literature Survey" - complete words on separate lines
✓ "Problem Identification" - complete words on separate lines
✓ "Project presentation Skill" - complete words on separate lines
✓ "Question and answer session" - complete words on separate lines
✓ All headers readable and professional
✓ USNs like "3GN22CS020" still display on one line (7pt font)
✓ Table fits within page width

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
Font Sizes:
- Base headers (Sl. No., Group No., etc.): 7pt
- Criteria headers: 6.5pt
- Leading: 8-9pt to prevent collision
