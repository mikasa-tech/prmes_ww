---

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`models.py`)
**Added:**
- `phase` column to `Evaluation` model (INTEGER, default=1)
- Updated unique constraint: `(student_id, phase, review_no)`

**Result:** Each student can now have up to 4 evaluations (one per phase/review combination)

### 2. Upload System (`app.py`)
**Modified:**
- Upload form now includes phase and review dropdowns
- Upload route captures `phase` and `review` from form data
- Only deletes evaluations for the specific phase/review being uploaded
- Evaluations are created/updated with phase information

**Result:** Independent upload and management of each phase/review

### 3. View Routes (`app.py`)
**Updated routes:**
- `/students` - Added phase/review filtering via query params
- `/students/groupwise` - Filter by phase/review
- `/students/guidewise` - Filter by phase/review
- `/students/individual` - Filter by phase/review

**Result:** All views now support filtering by specific phase/review combinations

### 4. User Interface (`templates/`)
**Updated `upload.html`:**
- Added Phase dropdown (Phase 1 / Phase 2)
- Added Review dropdown (Review 1 / Review 2)
- Improved form layout and styling

**Updated `students.html`:**
- Added visual phase/review selector with 4 buttons
- Shows currently selected phase/review
- All view option links pass phase/review parameters
- Green highlighting for active selection

**Result:** Easy navigation between different phase/review combinations

### 5. PDF Generation (`pdf_template.py`)
**Modified:**
- Dynamic phase number display (Phase I / Phase II)
- Dynamic review number display (Review I / Review II)
- PDF headers automatically show correct phase and review

**Result:** PDFs are correctly labeled for each phase/review

### 6. Migration Tools
**Created:**
- `migrate_db.py` - Automatic database migration script
- Handles adding phase column to existing databases
- Preserves all existing data (sets to Phase 1 by default)

**Result:** Seamless upgrade path for existing installations
